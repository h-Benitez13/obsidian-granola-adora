## Team onboarding

1. Open plugin settings.
2. Run `Export team config template` once in a configured vault.
3. Share `Adora/_setup/team-config.template.json` internally.
4. New teammates open that JSON file and run `Import team config from active file`.
5. Each teammate adds their own API keys/tokens.

### One-step onboarding command

- `Team one-step setup (import + full sync)`

What it does:

1. Loads team config from `Adora/_setup/team-config.template.json` (or active JSON file).
2. Imports shared non-sensitive settings.
3. Resets sync state.
4. Runs full sync.
5. Runs cross-linking pass.
