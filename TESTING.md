# Manual testing in Obsidian

This checklist is for manual QA inside Obsidian after installing the plugin.

## Recommended test setup

Use a test vault with these conditions:

1. The plugin is enabled.
2. `Settings → Granola Adora` is open in a second pane for quick toggles.
3. You have at least a few meeting notes, customer notes, and optionally synced Linear / Slack / GitHub / HubSpot content.
4. API keys are added only for the integrations you plan to validate.
5. If you are testing outbound flows, use a safe Slack channel and a test Notion destination.

## How to run a command in Obsidian

1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl+P`.
2. Type the command name exactly as shown below.
3. Press `Enter`.
4. Watch the notice popup and the target vault folder.

## Suggested smoke test before shipping

If you only have 10 minutes, run these in order:

1. `Sync meetings from Granola`
2. `Open Ask Adora chat panel`
3. `Generate weekly digest (AI)`
4. `Analyze meeting themes (AI)`
5. `Extract top customer asks (AI)`
6. `Re-link all notes (cross-integration)`
7. `Recalculate all customer health scores`
8. `Generate bot review summary`
9. `Generate bot recommendation from active note` using a known-good fixture note
10. `Export team config template`

That smoke pass covers sync, chat, AI generation, vault writes, review workflows, and onboarding output.
